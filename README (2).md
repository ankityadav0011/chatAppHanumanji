# Real-Time Chat Application

I developed a chat application that enables users to engage in real-time messaging, allowing them to share pictures, videos, and communicate seamlessly. The application uses Socket.io to implement bi-directional communication, ensuring real-time interactions between users. For security, all data transmissions are encrypted, and proper validation measures are in place to safeguard user information and prevent any malicious activity. This solution provides an intuitive and secure environment for users to chat and share multimedia content in real-time.
